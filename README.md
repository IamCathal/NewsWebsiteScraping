# BBC News Article Scraper

This script scrapes article titles and they keyword tags associated with the articles and compiles them into their respective csv files. All modules used are taken from the standard python library.

### Where does the script get it's articles from?

The script takes all articles from the RSS feeds of the Guardian, BBC and CNN. I might add more websites in the future if I have the time
